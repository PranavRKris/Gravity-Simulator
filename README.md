# Gravity-Simulator

This is a small project done on Pygames simulating the effects of gravity on a free mass near a planet. 
The simulation includes all the 8 planets with changing gravitational effect depending on the planet, this is not to scale as the changes in gravity for very big planets like jupitor is not esy to implement on such a small scale.
The project also has a small menu system to navigate through the different functionalities.
